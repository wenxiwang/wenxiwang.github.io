    <h3>Professor Wenxi Wang’s Research Group – PhD Positions </h3>
    <p>I’m excited to announce that my team is recruiting fully funded PhD students for Fall 2025, with the possibility of starting in Spring 2025. We offer a dynamic and collaborative environment for students passionate about cutting-edge research in computer science, particularly in areas that intersect machine learning, formal methods, and software engineering.</p>
    
    <h4>Our research focuses on (but is not limited to):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Combining Deep Learning with Automated Reasoning</strong>: We’re exploring how technologies like large language models (LLMs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and reinforcement learning can enhance automated reasoning tools such as SAT and SMT solvers.</li>
        <li><strong>Improving Code Generation Quality</strong>: We're using software verification and testing methods to improve the quality of code produced by LLMs.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhancing the Expressiveness of GNNs</strong>: By integrating formal methods and software engineering techniques, we aim to make GNNs more powerful in both expression and reasoning.</li>
        <li><strong>Strengthening the Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs</strong>: We’re investigating ways to push the boundaries of what LLMs can achieve in terms of reasoning.</li>
        <li><strong>Boosting the Reliability of ML Models and Frameworks</strong>: We're working on improving the robustness and reliability of machine learning frameworks like PyTorch through rigorous testing and verification techniques.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What We’re Looking For</h4>
    <p>If you're curious and driven, with a solid foundation in computer science and mathematics, and strong programming skills, I encourage you to apply. Specifically, you should:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Meet the eligibility requirements of the PhD program in Computer Science at the University of Virginia. More details are available on the <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/computer-science/academics/graduate-programs/phd-computer-science">department's website</a>.</li>
        <li>Have a genuine passion for research and an eagerness to explore new fields.</li>
        <li>Be a team player with strong communication and collaboration skills.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Additional experience that would make you stand out:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Familiarity with automated reasoning, software testing, deep learning, LLMs, or GNNs.</li>
        <li>Research or internship experience in areas like SAT/SMT solving, formal verification, automated code generation, or software security.</li>
        <li>Hands-on experience with tools like Kissat, Z3, Dafny, or Alloy.</li>
        <li>Publications in top-tier conferences related to machine learning, formal methods, software engineering, or security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How to Apply</h4>
    <p>Interested? Complete this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFl1Ix1pxDjD9CxWqpP68ZPk2Mfwypd6GIUvvfO28OvZnsWQ/viewform">Application Form</a> to get started. We’ll review applications throughly and schedule interviews accordingly.</p>

    <h4>About UVA and its CS Department</h4>
    <p>The University of Virginia (UVA), founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of the top public universities in the U.S., ranked 5th among public institutions and 24th overall in the 2024 US News rankings. According to CSRankings, UVA's Computer Science department is ranked in the top 5 in the nation for Software Engineering, Security, Formal Methods, and Artificial Intelligence. Our team thrives on interdisciplinary collaboration, offering rich resources and support to foster groundbreaking research.</p>

    <h4>Life in Charlottesville</h4>
    <p>Charlottesville, home to UVA, is a charming city known for its natural beauty and rich cultural history. Nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains, it’s a perfect place for anyone seeking a balance between academic life and outdoor adventures. The city is also steeped in history, with landmarks like Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello, and it’s just a two-hour drive from Washington D.C., providing access to a wealth of opportunities beyond the campus.</p>

    <p>We’re looking forward to working with driven, passionate students who are ready to tackle exciting research challenges. I hope to see you join our team and help push the boundaries of what’s possible!</p>
