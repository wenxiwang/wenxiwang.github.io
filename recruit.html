                        <h3>Hiperal Group Hiring– PhD and Internship Opportunities </h3>
                        <p>I’m excited to announce that  <a href="https://wenxiwang.github.io/group.html">Hiperal Group</a> is recruiting PhD students for Fall 2026 and internship students for all year round. We offer a dynamic and collaborative environment for students passionate about cutting-edge research in computer science, particularly in areas that intersect machine learning, formal methods, and software engineering.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Our research focuses on (but is not limited to):</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Combining Deep Learning with Automated Reasoning</strong>: We’re exploring how technologies like large language models (LLMs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and reinforcement learning can enhance automated reasoning tools such as SAT and SMT solvers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enhancing Software Verification with LLMs</strong>: We are developing novel methods to improve the scalability and usability of verification tools, such as Verus, Lean, Dafny, and Alloy, through the integration of LLMs. </li>
                            <li><strong>Strengthening the Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs</strong>: We’re investigating ways to push the boundaries of what LLMs can achieve in terms of reasoning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Improving Code Generation Quality</strong>: We're using software verification to improve the quality of code produced by LLMs. </li>
                            <li><strong>Boosting the Reliability of ML Models and Frameworks</strong>: We're working on improving the robustness and reliability of machine learning frameworks like PyTorch through rigorous testing and verification techniques.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>What We’re Looking For</h4>
