                            <strong> Research Interests: </strong> <br>
                            Dr. Wang’s research interests lie in the intersection 
                            of Software Engineering, Software Security, Formal Methods, 
                            and Machine Learning. Her research is dedicated to enhancing 
                            the security and reliability of software systems, including AI 
                            systems. To achieve this goal, she focuses on developing and 
                            applying efficient techniques in formal methods and machine 
                            learning, as well as exploring the synergies between these two 
                            fields.

                            <strong>Application:</strong>
                            <br>
                            Applicants should possess a strong academic background in 
                            computer science or related fields. While experience in systems,
                            machine learning, or formal methods is advantageous, it's your 
                            motivation for research, strong programming skills, and passion 
                            for innovation that will truly make you stand out.
